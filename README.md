# Stock_Price_Trend_Prediction_with_LSTM
The Stock Price Trend Prediction with LSTM project aims to predict future stock market trends by analyzing historical stock price data using deep learning techniques. It utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks â€” a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excels at capturing long-term dependencies in time-series data.
