WELCOME, EVERYONE!

Today, we're diving into an exciting intersection of finance and data science: predicting stock prices using Python and machine learning. In this Video, I'll explore how to harness Python's power, specifically using Jupyter Notebook, to create a predictive model for stock prices over the next 30 days.

My goal is to help you understand how you can use historical stock data as a foundation to make informed predictions. We'll start by pulling historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, preparing and structuring this data to suit our model's needs. From there, we'll apply an LSTM neural network-a type of deep learning model designed to capture patterns in sequential data.

Throughout this process, we'll cover essential data science techniques, including data ingestion, data preparation, model building, and evaluation.

By the end of this video, you'll not only have a functional code to forecast stock prices but also a deeper understanding of the challenges and considerations involved in time series forecasting.

Whether you're a data enthusiast, finance professional, or simply curious about the potential of mhine Barning, this presentation will equip you with actionable insighis and a hands-on approach to stock price prediction. Let's get started!

*What is LSTM???

LSTM, or Long Short-Term Memory, is a type of neural network architecture within the field of deep learning, specifically designed for handling sequential data and time series predictions.
LSTM networks are particularly good at learning from and making predictions based on patterns in data that have time dependencies, such as stock prices, weather patterns1or language sequences.

WHY USE LSTMS?

LSTMs are ideal for situations where the order of data points is essential and where patterns over time impact the outcome. This makes them popular for tasks like:
•Stock price prediction
•Speech recognition
•Language translation
•Video analysis
In short, LSTM networks are a specialized type of neural network designed to learn from sequences over time. By maintaining memory of previous data points, they help improve prediction accuracy for data with time-based patterns.
